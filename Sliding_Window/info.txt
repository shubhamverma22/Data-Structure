const arr = [2,3,5,2,9,7,1] , k = 3 (size of sub-array)
find max SubArray

2,3,5 --> 10
3,5,2 --> 10,
5,2,9 --> 16
2,9,7 --> 18    // this is max
9,7,1 --> 17

// How we can achieve using sliding window?
--> We only need to decrease first element of the window and add new element to the window

# Identify?
If in problem they ask for a SubArray 0r subString (largest, maximum, minimum) and there will be K i.e window size.
There might be a chances that they will not give you a window size.

# Types of Sliding window:-
1. Fixed Size window (K should be provided)
2. variable size window (K is not fixed or provided)
